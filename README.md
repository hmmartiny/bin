Functions or variables that I'll probably reuse a bunch of times, so I'll be lazy and save them.

## Structure
Saved the functions in a file structure according to what application they might be used in.

**Dictionary**: for easily working with dict structures

**PyTorch**: functions for extending any work made with PyTorch.

**bioinformatics**: variables and functions commonly used in bioinformatics workflows (e.g. amino acid to codons dict).

**mysql**: various functions for interacting with a MySQL database.

**notes**: Notes on commands that I do not see a directory to fit in (yet).
